# Prolog Informed and Uninformed Search

Implementation of informed (A*) and uninformed (IDS) search algorithms in logic programming.
The searches were applied to the following domains:
-Classic labyrinth
-A more complex game where a playable character slips from one side to another of the labyrinth. A heuristic applied to A* search helps the character reach a portal by collecting gems and breaking ice blocks.
